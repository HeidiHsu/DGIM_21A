    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>The story of a frog</h2>
    <p class="about1">Just a frog learning to do HTML and CSS before the pot gets too hot. The pot was sufficent to sustain an amphibian's life comfortably for many years, and the frog made a lot of friends. Unfortuniately, after a few rounds of economic crashes, the pot got pretty warm and many of frog's friends left the pot.</p>

    <p class="about2">The frog wants to leave too but needs to grow her leg muscles stronger before she can hop out of the pot. Learning HTML and CSS helps the frog to flex her muscles and while looking for a cooler place to go. And such is the story of a frog.</p>
